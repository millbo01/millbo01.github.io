## **Policy (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Habit, Automation, Cached behavior, Efficiency, Learning

**Definition:**

Automatic action mapping from cues to behavior, formed through reinforcement and stored for efficient reuse without deliberation.

**Full Explanation:**

A policy is "if X, then Y" stored in procedural memory. Policies are how brains achieve efficiency—you don't re-decide every action from first principles. When cue X appears, policy Y runs automatically. This is adaptive when environment is stable, but becomes maladaptive when environment changes and policy is outdated.

Most behavior is policy-driven, not deliberate choice. People experience themselves as "deciding" but they're usually running cached policies formed through past reinforcement. The "decision" is just consciousness narrating what the policy already selected.

Three key characteristics:

1. **Cue-triggered:** Policies run automatically when environment presents the trigger
2. **Reinforcement-formed:** Policies encode "what worked before" in similar contexts
3. **Update-resistant:** Once formed, policies persist even when they stop working (requires sustained disconfirming feedback to override)

The reason "knowing better" doesn't change behavior: knowledge updates the model, but policies bypass the model entirely. You can know smoking is bad (model) while still automatically reaching for cigarettes when stressed (policy). The policy formed through years of reinforcement doesn't disappear just because the model changed.

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

Driver takes same route to work for years (policy formed). One day construction blocks the route. First few times, they drive toward the block automatically before consciously remembering and redirecting (policy still running despite model update). Takes weeks of repeated interruption before new route becomes the automatic policy. The old policy doesn't "know" it's outdated—it just runs when cued.

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Child grows up in chaotic household where showing emotion triggered parent rage. Forms policy: "Feel emotion → suppress immediately → stay safe." This policy was adaptive—it protected the child. As adult in safe environment, policy still runs. They can't access their emotions, feel "numb," struggle with intimacy. Therapy helps them understand the pattern (model update) but the policy still fires automatically when emotion arises. Requires years of safe experiences (sustained reinforcement) to form new policy that allows emotional expression.

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

Treating automatic behavior as deliberate choice, leading to moral judgment. "They know it's wrong but keep doing it"—assumes behavior is model-driven when it's actually policy-driven. Also leads to ineffective interventions: "just decide to change" doesn't work against policies formed through thousands of repetitions.

**Diagnostic questions:**

- Is this behavior deliberate or automatic?
- What cue triggers it?
- What past reinforcement formed this policy?
- Has environment changed such that policy is now maladaptive?
- What sustained reinforcement would form new policy?

**Intervention principle:**

Can't remove policies—can only override with new ones. Three approaches:

1. **Remove cue:** Change environment so trigger doesn't appear
2. **Insert friction:** Add steps between cue and behavior, forcing deliberation
3. **Replace policy:** Form new automatic response to same cue through sustained practice

"Just stop doing X" fails against policies. Need structural intervention that either prevents policy activation or builds competing policy through repeated reinforcement.
